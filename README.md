# AflAnalysis-
Developed a predictive model for Australian Football League (AFL) match attendance, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and extensive feature engineering to improve regression accuracy. Utilised performance metrics, seasonal trends, and miscellaneous factors to predict attendance. Created new features to enhance model interpretability and predictive power. Implemented Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, LightGBM, and a Deep Neural Network to handle complex, categorical-heavy data. Applied encoding techniques, missing value handling, and feature scaling for optimal model performance. Reduced Mean Absolute Error (MAE) through iterative improvements in data preparation and model tuning.
